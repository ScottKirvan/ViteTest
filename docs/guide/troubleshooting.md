# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

**Setup panel appears instead of the chat panel**

Cortex couldn't find your Claude Code installation. Follow the on-screen steps, or if Claude Code is already installed, enter the full path to the binary in the path field. See the [Claude Code install guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview#native-install-recommended).

---

**"Claude Code is not authenticated" error after sending a message**

Claude Code is installed but not logged in. Click **Open terminal** in the error card — a terminal will open running Claude Code. Follow the prompts to authenticate (a browser window will open). Click **Done** when finished.

---

**Plugin doesn't appear in Obsidian after installing**

Ensure Safe Mode is disabled (**Settings → Community Plugins**) and that the `cortex/` folder contains both `main.js` and `manifest.json`. Restart Obsidian after installing.

---

**Claude doesn't seem to know about my vault structure**

Check that your context file exists at the configured path (`_claude-context.md` by default) and contains useful information about your vault. Also check that **Vault tree depth** is not set to Off.

---

**Claude is doing something unexpected mid-task**

Click the **Stop** button (square icon in the input bar) to interrupt immediately. Claude's process and any subprocesses are killed. Files already written before you stopped will remain — review them before continuing. Start a new session or send a follow-up to correct course.

---

**Claude seems to be running but nothing is happening**

If the status indicator has been showing for a long time with no output, Claude may be stuck. Click **Stop**, then try again. Run `claude --version` in a terminal to confirm the install is visible to your shell.

---

## Logging

Cortex writes a debug log by default to `.obsidian/plugins/cortex/cortex-debug.log` — inside the plugin folder, not your vault, so it won't appear in Obsidian's file browser or your git history.

Each Obsidian launch appends a `--- Cortex log started ---` marker so you can find session boundaries. Delete the file manually to clear it.

**Verbosity levels:**

| Level | What's logged |
|---|---|
| **Normal** *(default)* | Session events, tool calls, spawns, errors |
| **Verbose** | Everything above plus raw stream chunks and token breakdowns — produces large files quickly |

All settings take effect immediately without restarting Obsidian.

::: tip
The log file is not visible in Obsidian's file browser — no `.gitignore` entry needed.

## Known Limitations

- **Desktop only** — Obsidian mobile is not supported (Node.js APIs unavailable on mobile)
- **Claude Code must be installed via a terminal** — on Windows use PowerShell; on Mac/Linux use Terminal
- **One active session at a time** — concurrent sessions are not supported
- Claude operates with full vault access — no per-file infrastructure enforcement (see [Per-note Frontmatter](./context-system#5-per-note-frontmatter-context) for convention-based protection)
- Sessions are stored in `.obsidian/cortex/sessions/` which is typically gitignored; sessions do not sync across devices
