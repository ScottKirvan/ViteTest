# Session Manager

Open the session manager by clicking the **session name** in the panel toolbar, or via **Cortex: Show session history** in the Command Palette.

## Actions

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| **Resume a session** | Click any row |
| **Save to vault** | Hover a row → click the **download icon** → enter export path |
| **Rename** | Click the **pencil icon** → edit inline → Enter or click away |
| **Delete** | Click the **trash icon** → confirm |
| **Reorder** | Drag the ⠿ grip handle up or down |
| **Filter** | Type in the search box at the top |

## Active Session

The currently open session is marked with an accent-coloured left border and bold title.

## Sort Order

Sessions are listed most-recent-first by default. Once you drag any row, that order is saved and persists across restarts. New sessions are always inserted at the top of the list — drag them into position afterwards.

::: tip
Drag handles are hidden while the search filter is active — filtering shows a subset, so reordering would produce confusing results.

## Token Cost Model

Understanding when tokens are spent helps you use Cortex efficiently.

| Action | Token cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Opening the panel | Free | No API call |
| Switching sessions in History | Free | Local disk read only |
| Browsing session history | Free | All local |
| **First message of a new session** | **Full price** | Context injection + prompt; cache created |
| **Continuing a session (within ~1 hour)** | **Cheap** | History from prompt cache (~10× cheaper) |
| **Resuming after restart or 1+ hour gap** | **Full price** | Cache expired; history re-charged as fresh tokens |

::: tip
Claude's prompt cache expires after ~1 hour. For sessions you haven't used in a while, starting a new session (paying only for context injection) may be cheaper than resuming a large accumulated one.
